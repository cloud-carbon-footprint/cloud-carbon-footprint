# Cloud Carbon Footprint

[![CI](https://github.com/ThoughtWorks-Cleantech/cloud-carbon-footprint/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?event=check_run)](https://github.com/ThoughtWorks-Cleantech/cloud-carbon-footprint/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

[Cloud Carbon Footprint](https://www.cloudcarbonfootrpint.org) is an application that estimates the energy (kilowatt hours) and carbon emissions (metric tons CO2e) of public cloud provider utilization.

If you would like to learn more about the various calculations and constants that we use for the emissions estimates, check out the [Methodology page](microsite/docs/Methodology.md)

## Getting Started

The core logic is exposed through 2 applications: a CLI and a website. The CLI resides in `packages/cli/`, and the website is split between `packages/api/` and `packages/client/`

For instructions on how to get up and running, please visit the [Getting Started page](microsite/docs/GettingStarted.md).
