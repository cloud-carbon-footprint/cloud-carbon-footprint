title: Run with Mocked Data
---

If you are looking to get up and running quickly or are not ready to connect to real cloud provider data, it is possible to run the app using mocked data.

To do so, run the following command:

    yarn start-with-mock-data

This will run the webapp in development mode, using a mocked server. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in a browser.
