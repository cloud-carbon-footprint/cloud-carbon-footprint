title: Getting Set Up

In order to run Cloud Carbon Footprint locally, there are a few things you must do to get set up first.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 12 (tip: use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [n](https://github.com/tj/n) to manage multiple Node versions)

#### Optional Prerequisites

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (to download the AWS CLI)

- AWS CLI `brew install awscli` (if you are authenticating with AWS - see below)

- Talisman (if you want to commit code)

        curl --silent https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoughtworks/talisman/master/global_install_scripts/install.bash > /tmp/install_talisman.bash && /bin/bash /tmp/install_talisman.bash

Note:

- During install, Talisman may fail to add the pre-commit hook to this repository because one already exists for Husky. This is fine because it can still execute in the existing husky pre-commit hook, once installed.

- During install, Talisman will also ask you for the directory of your git repositories. If you don't want to install Talisman in all your git repos, then cancel out at this step.

### Setup

    yarn install

This will install dependencies for all packages. We use [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) to manage both projects.
