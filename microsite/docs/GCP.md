Your Google Cloud Account needs to be configured to export Billing Data to BigQuery, and the application needs to authenticate with GCP to run queries on that data in BigQuery.

1.  Ensure you have a GCP Service Account with the permission to start BigQuery jobs and read Bigquery job results. Learn more about GCP Service Accounts [here.](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts)

2.  Ensure that your enviroment is configured to authenticate with Google Cloud as described [here](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started).

    - If you do download a service accout key, make sure `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` points to full path of the service account key file.

3.  Set up Google Cloud billing data to export to BigQuery. You can find the instructions for this [here](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/export-data-bigquery).

4.  Configure environmental variables for the api and client:

    - After configuring your credentials, we need to set a number of environmental variables in the app, so it can authenticate. We use .env files to manage this. Reference [packages/api/.env.template](https://github.com/cloud-carbon-footprint/cloud-carbon-footprint/blob/trunk/packages/api/.env.template) for a template .env file. Rename this file as .env, optionally remove the comments and then set the environment variables for the “Billing Data'' approach. If you are only using one of these cloud providers, you can remove the environment variables associated with the other cloud provider in your `packages/api/.env` file.

    - There is also a `packages/client/.env` file that allows you to set some configuration for the data range the application requests data for. See [client/.env.template](https://github.com/cloud-carbon-footprint/cloud-carbon-footprint/blob/trunk/packages/client/.env.template) for a template. Rename this file as .env, optionally remove the comments and then set the environment variables.

    - By default, the client uses AWS, GCP and Azure. If you are only using one of these cloud providers, please update the `appConfig` object in the [client Config file](https://github.com/cloud-carbon-footprint/cloud-carbon-footprint/blob/trunk/packages/client/src/Config.ts) to only include your provider in the `CURRENT_PROVIDERS` array.

    -  `GCP_BIG_QUERY_TABLE` is the Table ID of the billing export data in the format: `PROJECT_ID.DATASET_NAME.TABLE_NAME`. Don't forget to replace the colon in the table id if you copy it from BigQuery.
    -  `GCP_BILLING_PROJECT_ID` is the project id for the project that owns the Billing Export dataset.
    -  `GCP_BILLING_PROJECT_NAME` is the project name for the project that owns the Billing Export dataset.

5.  Finally, start up the application:

        yarn start

⚠️ This will incur some cost. Use this sparingly if you wish to test with live data.

DISCLAIMER: If your editor of choice is VS Code, we recommend using either your native or custom terminal of choice (i.e. iterm) instead. Unexpected authentication issues have occurred when starting up the server in VS Code terminals.

### Unsupported Usage Types

The application has a file containing supported usage types located [here](https://github.com/cloud-carbon-footprint/cloud-carbon-footprint/blob/trunk/packages/core/src/services/gcp/BillingExportTypes.ts). The current lists consist of types the application has faced, so there are likely to be some types not yet handled. When querying your data, you may come across unsupported types with a warning like this:

`2021-03-31T09:48:38.815Z [BillingExportTable] warn: Unsupported Usage unit: Filestore Capacity Standard`

If you come across a similar warning message, congratulations! You have found a usage type that the app currently isn’t aware of - this is a great opportunity for you to improve Cloud Carbon Footprint!

The steps to resolve are:

1. Determine the type in question based on the warning message
2. Add the type to the respective list in the `BillingExportTypes.ts` file
3. Delete `estimates.cache.json` file and restart the application server
4. Submit an issue or pull request with the update

### Options for Google Authentication

We currently only support authentication with Google via the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.
