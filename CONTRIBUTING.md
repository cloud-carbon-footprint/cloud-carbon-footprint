# Contributing to cloud-carbon-footprint

## Issues ‚Äã‚õî
Issues are created [here](https://github.com/ThoughtWorks-Cleantech/cloud-carbon-footprint/issues).

Issues will be closed if they have been inactive and the latest affected version no longer receives support.

_If an issue has been closed and you still feel it's relevant, feel free to ping a maintainer or add a comment!_

### How to Contribute in Issues
There are fundamentally three ways an individual can contribute:

1) **Open an issue:** If you believe that you have found a new bug, you should report it by creating a new issue in the `ThoughtWorks-Cleantech/cloud-carbon-footprint` issue tracker.
1) **Help triage an open issue:** You can do this either by providing assistive details (a reproducible test case that demonstrates a bug) or by providing suggestions to address the issue.
1) **Resolve an open issue:** This can be done by demonstrating that the issue is not a bug or is fixed; but more often, by opening a pull request that changes the source in `ThoughtWorks-Cleantech/cloud-carbon-footprint` in a concrete and reviewable manner.

### Asking for General Help
- _TBD_: Find point of contact or setup discussion board for general help? (instead of creating an issue)  

### Submitting a Bug Report
To submit a bug report:

When opening a new issue in the `ThoughtWorks-Cleantech/cloud-carbon-footprint` issue tracker, users will be presented with a [bug report template](/.git/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/Bug_report.md) that should be filled in.

If you believe that you have found a bug in the cloud-carbon-footprint, please fill out the given template to the best of your ability.

### Triaging a Bug Report
It's common for open issues to involve discussion. Some contributors may have differing opinions, including whether the behavior is a bug or feature. This discussion is part of the process and should be kept focused, helpful, and professional.

Terse responses that provide neither additional context nor supporting detail are not helpful or professional. To many, such responses are annoying and unfriendly.

Contributors are encouraged to solve issues collaboratively and help one another make progress. If you encounter an issue that you feel is invalid, or which contains incorrect information, explain why you feel that way with additional supporting context, and be willing to be convinced that you may be wrong. By doing so, we can often reach the correct outcome faster.

### Resolving a Bug Report
Most issues are resolved by opening a pull request. The process for opening and reviewing a pull request is similar to that of opening and triaging issues, but carries with it a necessary review and approval workflow that ensures that the proposed changes meet the minimal quality and functional guidelines of the cloud-carbon-footprint project.

## Pull Requests üì•

Pull Requests are the way concrete changes are made to the code, documentation, dependencies, and tools contained in the `ThoughtWorks-Cleantech/cloud-carbon-footprint` repository.

## Setting up your local environment

### Fork & Clone
Fork the project on GitHub and clone your fork locally.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:[your-username-here]/cloud-carbon-footprint.git
$ cd cloud-carbon-footprint
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/ThoughtWorks-Cleantech/cloud-carbon-footprint
$ git fetch upstream 
```

### Build
See the [main repository README](https://github.com/ThoughtWorks-Cleantech/cloud-carbon-footprint/blob/trunk/README.md) for build directions. 

### Branch
The ThoughtWorks Cloud Carbon Footprint team uses [Trunk-Based Development](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/enabling-trunk-based-development-deployment-pipelines). 
You're welcome to keep your local development environment organized as you like, however when submitting pull requests to the base repository, be sure to submit them against the `trunk` branch. In order to avoid merge conflicts in your pull request, you'll need to successfully rebase ahead of your pull request: 

```
$ git fetch upstream
$ git rebase upstream/trunk
$ git push origin/trunk
``` 

### Code
Most pull requests opened against the `ThoughtWorks-Cleantech/cloud-carbon-footprint` repository include changes to either the Typescript/React code in the client/ folder, the Typescript code in the packages/api/ folder or the documentation.

#### Linting
- We are using `eslint` and `prettier` in the project
- To avoid the hassle of manually linting the file, you can configure your IDE to automatically run the
  linter.
- If you are using Webstorm, check out [this](https://prettier.io/docs/en/webstorm.html) guide on how to
  set it up
- The prettier rules set up for the project are in `.prettierrc.json` file in the root DIR.
- The client and the server have their own ESLint rules in the respective `.eslintrc.js` files.
- Following the above rules is a pre-requisite for committing any code.

#### Testing

- Run `yarn test` from the root directory.
- If you are missing a test file in the coverage report, you may need to clear the test cache by running
  `yarn test:clean` from the client and / or server DIR.

  This is also one of the pre-commit hook but it is also advisable to run tests regularly.

### Commit
It is recommended to keep your changes grouped logically within individual commits. Many contributors find it easier to review changes that are split across multiple commits. There is no limit to the number of commits in a pull request. Please be sure to include your issue number in brackets and use easy to understand commit messages that summarize the work that you've done. A good commit message should describe what changed and why. See example below as reference.

```
$ git commit -m "[issue-number] Adds support for estimating Azure Anomoly Detector carbon emissions"
```
*Please Note* We have configured the repository to run secrets scanning (Talisman), dependency version check (Hawkeye), tests and linting with a pre-commit hook. It is recommended you ensure this pre-commit hook is properly set up in your local environment, and to only commit from the command line to ensure that it runs. 

### Rebase
Once you have committed your changes, it is a good idea to use git rebase (not git merge) to synchronize your work with the main repository.

```
$ git fetch upstream
$ git rebase upstream/trunk
```

This ensures that your working branch has the latest changes from `ThoughtWorks-Cleantech/cloud-carbon-footprint` trunk.

### Test
While our tests run every time you commit thanks to the pre-commit hook described above, if you would like to run the tests idependant of a commit, use the following:
```
$ yarn test
```
### Push
Once your commits are ready to go -- with passing tests and linting -- begin the process of opening a pull request by pushing your working branch to your fork on GitHub.
``` 
$ git push origin my-branch
```

### Opening the Pull Request
From within GitHub, opening a new pull request will present you with a [template](https://github.com/ThoughtWorks-Cleantech/cloud-carbon-footprint/blob/trunk/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) that should be filled out: 

### Discuss and Update
You will probably get feedback or requests for changes to your pull request. This is a big part of the submission process so don't be discouraged! Some contributors may sign off on the pull request right away. Others may have detailed comments or feedback. This is a necessary part of the process in order to evaluate whether the changes are correct and necessary.

To make changes to an existing pull request, make the changes to your local branch, add a new commit with those changes, and push those to your fork. GitHub will automatically update the pull request.

```
$ git add my/changed/files
$ git commit
$ git push origin my-branch
```

There are a number of more advanced mechanisms for managing commits using git rebase that can be used, but are beyond the scope of this guide.

Feel free to post a comment in the pull request to ping reviewers if you are awaiting an answer on something.

#### Approval and Request Changes Workflow
TBD: Add context on approval and request change workflow

## Bundle size analysis üîç
 From the client folder 
- Run `yarn build -- --stats ` then 
- Run ` yarn webpack-bundle-analyzer build/bundle-stats.json `

The above commands might be added to the package.json if we are so inclined

This will help in visualizing the bundle size, seeing bundles that might not be required in production, etc,.

---

## Continuous Integration Pipeline üîÅ
We use CircleCI for our pipeline. [Link to pipeline](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ThoughtWorks-Cleantech/cloud-carbon-footprint).

You can learn more about CircleCI in the [CircleCI Documentation](https://circleci.com/docs/)

---

## Approval for Production
When pushing up, CircleCI will automatically go through the steps of deploying to staging as long as all tests and linting past.

To deploy to production, go to CircleCI and view the build to deploy. It is a manual approval, therefore if it is ready to be
pushed into production, click on the `Hold` step and a pop-up should appear that asks to approve. Click approve and CircleCI
will deploy to production.

--- 

## Package management üì¶
- We use yarn for package management.
- To install a new package, use `yarn add package-name` (production) or `yarn add --dev package-name` (development) inside either the client or server directory.
- Use `yarn install` at the root directory to have all packages freshly installed. 

### Updating Packages
- To update a package to the patch or minor version, use the command `yarn update <package-name>`
- To update a package to the latest major version, use `yarn upgrade --latest <package-name>`

---

## Module Aliasing üéõÔ∏èÔ∏è
We've set up module aliasing within the server package, so modules within the sub directories can be accessed with the @ prefix, e.g. @application/Module/. We implemented this by configuring tsconfig.json, jest.config.js and installing the `tsconfig-paths` package.

---

## Lightweight ADR's (Architectural Decision Records) üìÑ

We record any significant architectural choices we make with lightweight adr files, located in the .adr folder. There is a template included as well. For more information about Lightweight ADR's, see [ThoughtWork's Technology Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/lightweight-architecture-decision-records).

---

## Hawkeye üëÅ
- Used to check node packaging and vulnerability
- This will run along every pre-commit hook
- to run isolated, cd into server or client and run: `yarn hawkeye scan`
- You can learn more about Hawkeye [here](https://github.com/hawkeyesec/scanner-cli)

---

## Talisman üíç
- Used to check for potential secrets or sensitive information 
- This will run along every pre-commit hook
- You can learn more about Talisman [here](https://github.com/thoughtworks/talisman) 

---

## Logging
- We are using [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) for logging locally and Google's [logging-winston](https://github.com/googleapis/nodejs-logging-winston) for Logging in Google App Engine.
- The LOGGING_MODE can set inside the api/.env file, but by default it should be unset for local development.  
- packages/api/logs contain the log files that written to by the logger. This should be deleted occasionally, otherwise it will become unnecessarily large.

---

## Webstorm IDE Development Configurations ‚õàÔ∏è
-  Open the TypeScript tool window (View | Tool Windows | TypeScript) and switch to the Errors tab.
The tab lists the discrepancies in the code detected by the TypeScript Language Service. The list is updated dynamically as you change your code for easier and faster debugging.  

- You can also monitor compilation errors by going to the TypeScript tool window (View | Tool Windows | TypeScript),
and switching to the Compile errors tab which shows up only after first manual compilation, when you click the :hammer: button and select the compilation scope.

#### Cleaning up Local
 - packages/api/logs contain the log files that written to by the logger. This should be deleted occasionally, otherwise it will 
 become infinitely large.
 
 - Delete estimate.cache.json to pull new data when testing to get most up to date data and verify querying is working 
 as expected 

---

## VSCode IDE Development Configurations üñ•Ô∏è
- To run test on IDE, install the extension, `Jest Runner`, from marketplace

---

## Troubleshoot ‚ö†Ô∏è
### Cloud Provider

#### GCP
If GCP credentials are not linked properly, there may be an error regarding AWS credentials not being set properly. This
has been caused by either out of date credentials on GCP, or the GCP credentials not being set properly on the local environment

### Talisman
#### Installing
- If you are receiving the following error, you may have installed Talisman wrong 
`sh: /talisman_hook_script: No such file or directory error.`
- To resolve check your env var by `echo $TALISMAN_HOME`, if it is installed correctly it will echo out a 
path `/Users/username/.talisman/bin`. If not, please refer to the README.md for instructions to install talisman
- If this variable is set, check to make sure you have the /talisman_hook_script within that directory

#### Overwritting Checks
- If there is an invalid check from Talisman, the failed commit will contain a checksum that you can add to 
the .talismanrc, which will allow it to pass for that commit.
- However this checksum is only valid for that specific commit, if the file changed, and it has a talisman check, it 
will run a new checksum for the .talismanrc that will have to be updated

### CircleCI
- Sometimes the CircleCI build fails due to a `ENOMEM: not enough memory, read` error. This is a transient error and you can just restart the build from the last failed job.
