# CCF Infrastructure Setup on ECS (AWS/Terraform)

## Overview

This directory contains basic infrastructure code to set up the application in AWS using basic services such as ECS, IAM, Route53. The goal is to have a simple and generic setup that can be configured to each customer needs.

Although the aim was to remain generic, some things might not be entirely applicable to your particular case e.g. you might not have a VPN setup to access private compute instances. You should consider revisiting the architecture and adjusting the infrastructure accordingly.

### Architecture

The general architecture consists of the following components:

- ECS services, tasks and instance profile
- Security Group
- IAM Policies and Roles
- ALB, listeners, listener rules
- IP Target Groups
- CloudWatch logging group
