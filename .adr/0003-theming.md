# 3. Theming

## Decision 

Use Material UI's theming support to define the app's look and feel.

## Context 

We wanted to have a dark theme to our application as well as define more colors
for our charts and graphs.

## Consequences 

We use Material UI's default dark and light theme, switchable by the OS's mode
(light/dark). The chart colors are an custom extension of Material UI's palette
and are defined by design.
