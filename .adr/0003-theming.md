Title — Theming
Decision — Use Material UI's theming support to define the app's look and feel.
Context — We wanted to have a dark theme to our application as well as define more colors for our charts and graphs.
Consequences — We use Material UI's default dark and light theme, switchable by the OS's mode (light/dark). The chart colors are an custom extension of Material UI's palette and are defined by design.
