# 15. Extract app and common packages

Date: 2021-05-26

## Status

Accepted

## Decision 

Create two new packages called app and common. The app package contains the
logic to run the application and is a dependancy of api/cli. The common package
is for functionality that is shared across multiple packages.

## Context 

We want to eventually extract the cloud provider specific logic into packages
specific to each cloud provider. This change will make this easier so we can
avoid circular dependancies.

## Consequences

- We now have more packages to manage and reason about. They are smaller in
size though, so hopefully this doesn't become unmanagable.

- The CI/CD pipeline has been updated to scale as we add more packages that are
dependant on each other.

- This will make extracting the cloud provider functionality to their own
packages easier, out of the app and core packages.
