# 9. Remove filters api

Date: 2021-03-02

## Status

Accepted

## Decision 

Remove the filters api

## Context

- This api was originally created to have a single source of truth for filters.
- However when running the application was hundreds of Account, Regions and Services it becomes unmanageable to configure these.
- Instead, the client can determine the filters based on the estimation results themselves.
    
## Consequences

- Decouples the client from the server side configuration.
- Potentially slows down the client rendering a bit.
