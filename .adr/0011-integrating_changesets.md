# 11. Integrating changesets

Date: 2021-03-9

# Status

Accepted

## Decision 

We will use changesets for versioning with action scripts to automate github
releases/tags and publishing packages to npm

## Context 

In preparation for going open-source, we wanted to create a more structured
versioning process. Changesets allows for organized semantic versioning updates
and helps integrate automation for releasing and publishing.

## Consequences 

After a feature is finished or an external contribution is made, a user will
manually run the changeset command to pick which and how the packages should be
updated. Changesets automates the creation of a PR which will be reviewed and
merged on a regular basis.
