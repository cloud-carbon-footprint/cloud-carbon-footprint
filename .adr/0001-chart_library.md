Title — Chart library
Decision — ApexCharts was chosen
Context —  We need a chart library for data visualization. ApexCharts provides a wide amount of charts with extended behavior which covers initial business requirements. Open source licence. React wrapper available.
Consequences — This library might not be as customizable as those based on D3. E.g. it does not offer a geomap chart.
