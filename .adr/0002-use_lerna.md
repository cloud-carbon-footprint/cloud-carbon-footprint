# 2. Use Lerna

Date: 2020-08-27

## Status

Accepted


## Decision 

Use Lerna (https://lerna.js.org) to manage packages and scripts for the client
and the server

## Context 

We wanted a consistent way of running linters, formatters, tests, and the
packages themselves. We had gaps in some of these behaviors when we introduced
the client code to this repository. Lerna covers these gaps.

## Consequences 

Removal of the scripts directory. In addition, there may be unforeseen bugs and
issue that are centered around Lerna that could block us in the future.
However, the pros of a consistent codebase outweighs this risk.
