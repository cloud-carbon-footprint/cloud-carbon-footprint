# 16. Extract gcp, aws and azure packages

Date: 2021-06-03

## Status

Accepted

## Decision

Create three new packages called aws, gcp and azure. Each package contains the
cloud provider specific data that once lived in the core and app packages. Each
package will have app as a dependant and common and core as dependencies.

## Context

We wanted to extract the cloud provider specific logic into packages specific
to each cloud provider. Now the core package only contains the core business
logic and each cloud provider package can hold its specific data and features.

## Consequences

- We now have more packages to manage and reason about. They are smaller in
size though, so hopefully this doesn't become unmanageable.

- The CI/CD pipeline has been updated to scale as we add more packages that are
dependant on each other.

- As we further evolve the application, it now makes more sense for cloud
provider specific features (ie. recommendation components) to live in each
respective cloud provider package.
