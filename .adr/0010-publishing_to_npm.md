# 10. Publishing to npm

Date: 2021-02-27

## Status

Accepted

## Decision 

We will independently publish each package

## Context 

In preparation for going open-source, we wanted to independently publish our
cli, api, core logic, and frontend packages to npm. This gives flexibility to
our users: some might use the cli, some might spin up their own version of thhe
api, and others might want to build their own frontend using our components.

## Consequences 

We moved the cli and core logic out of our server package, and renamed server
to api. Each package has its own package.json and is set up to be independently
versioned. We also updated our ci to build our instance of the api from source
(ie using latest @cloud-carbon-footprint packages), rather than depending on
published versions.
