Title — Integration Tests
Decision — Adding integration tests makes the application covered through the user journey on the client side and ensures the correct data is being loaded and displayed.
Context — As the application continues to grow and continually update, it is important that the base level integration tests will continue to pass to keep the app functioning properly.
Consequences — Now that integration tests have been introduced, work flows can be added to ensure that any updates that end up deployed are passing all of the tests.
