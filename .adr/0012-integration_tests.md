# 12. Integration Tests

Date: 2021-03-29

## Status

Accepted

## Decision 

Adding integration tests makes the application covered through the user journey
on the client side and ensures the correct data is being loaded and displayed.

## Context 

As the application continues to grow and continually update, it is important
that the base level integration tests will continue to pass to keep the app
functioning properly.

## Consequences 

Now that integration tests have been introduced, work flows can be added to
ensure that any updates that end up deployed are passing all of the tests.
