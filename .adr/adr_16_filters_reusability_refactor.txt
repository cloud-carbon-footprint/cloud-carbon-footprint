Title — Refactor Filters for Reusability
Decision — Move the filters and its core logic to the common folder and refactor its logic to no longer be specific to
the Emissions Metrics Page.
Context — We needed to implement a similar filters feature on the newly created Recommendations page. Refactoring the
logic of the existing filter allowed for easy adoption of the current components that we have, as well as for easy reuse
of the filters' logic in the future in case it's needed elsewhere.
Consequences
- Implementing new filters will require understanding the current architecture and creating appropriate subclasses and
subcomponents
- Any pages using the filters' architecture can now follow the same pattern and share the same core logic
- Filters setup may cause a lot of overhead for simple use cases, and logic is coupled to the filter bar
(no customizable styling)
