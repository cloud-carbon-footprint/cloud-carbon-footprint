# 6. Remove Containers from CircleCI

Date: 2020-09-27

## Status

Accepted

## Decision

Remove Docker image creation and publishing as part of the CircleCI build
pipeline.

Keep Dockerfiles in the client and server packages to use locally, or if we
want to use Docker images again in the build pipeline later.

## Context

Google Cloud Platform have deprecated support for Docker images in Google App
Engine Standard.

We want to keep the benefits of serverless infrastructure (elasticity & faster
deploy time) that App Engine Standard provides

Consequences:

If we want to deploy Containers again the the future, we will need to re-add
the creation and publishing to a container registry.
