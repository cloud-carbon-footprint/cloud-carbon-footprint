# 8. Billing Data OpFeature Flag for Cloud Carbon Estimation

## Status

Accepted

## Decision

Add a feature flag "USE_AWS_BILLING_DATA" that pulls usage information from AWS
Cost and Usage Reports instead of CloudWatch and Cost Explorer APIs

Add a feature flag "USE_GCP_BILLING_DATA" that pulls usage information from GCP
Billing Export Table instead of the Cloud Monitoring API

## Context

The previous appraoch would loop through cloud provider accounts, regions and
services individually to pull data and estimate energy/carbon usage.

This requires your to configure all your cloud provider accounts, as well as
ensure all services are implemented.

This new approach, using cloud provider billing data, allows for a more
holistic estimation of cloud energy and carbon usage as it pulls data for all
regions and services by default.

## Consequences

This billing data approach doesn't use actual CPU Utilization, but a predefined
constants AVG_CPU_UTILIZATION_2020. This may make it less acurate.

New permissions and environment variables are needed to be set for this billing
data appriach to work.
