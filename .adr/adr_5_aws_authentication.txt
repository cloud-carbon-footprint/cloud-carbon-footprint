Title: AWS Authentication
Decision:
    - Setup a proxy AWS Account with an Identity Provider for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that can issue temporary AWS Security Token Service (STS) tokens.
    - Setup a "ccf" role in target accounts that has the required CloudWatch and Cost Explorer permissions and allows a role in the proxy account to assume it.
    - Configure the necessary environment variables at build time in CircleCI in order for the authentication to work.
Context:
    - We wanted a secure way to authenciate and run cloud-carbon-footprint against multiple AWS Accounts
    - We didn't want to store API keys/credentials on our GCP App Engine instance.
Consequences:
    — In order to run the application locally with a GCP Service Account, you need to correctly configure your server/.env file, and ensure the Service Account Unique ID is added to the proxy account Identity Provider.
    - New accounts that you want to run cloud-carbon-footprint against need to add the "ccf" or the "ccf-athena" roles found in the /cloudformation directory.
