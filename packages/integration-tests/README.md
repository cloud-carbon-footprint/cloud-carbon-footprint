# Integration Tests

Integration tests for verifying Cloud Carbon Footprint packages.

## Usage

This package is only meant for usage within the Cloud Carbon Footprint monorepo.

All packages need to be installed before running the test. In a fresh clone of this repo you first need to run the following from the repo root:

```sh
yarn install
```

Once this task is completed, you can now navigate to the `packages/integration-tests` directory and run the tests using either `yarn headless` or `yarn headed` to see the tests run in a chrome browser.
