        conversion factors [Wh]) x (Cloud provider Power Usage Effectiveness
        [PUE]) x (grid emissions factors [metric tons CO2e])

        Cloud Carbon Footprint includes CO2e emissions estimates for cloud
        compute, storage, networking and memory.
        <br />
        <br />
        Currently, for compute usage, we also factor in embodied emissions,
        which is the amount of carbon emitted during the creation and disposal
        of a hardware device. We provide more detail in our methodology linked
        below.
        <br />
        <br />
        Emissions data points marked with an * have been estimated with average
        CPU Utilization because the actual CPU Utilization is not available.

        <br />
        Cloud Provider regions on map are an approximation based on public
        information given by each cloud provider. Regional grid emissions factor
        sources vary based on country.
