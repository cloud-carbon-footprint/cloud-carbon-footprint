        Currently we estimate CO2e emissions for cloud compute, storage and
        networking. Memory usage is not estimated yet due to their arguably
        comparatively small footprint and current lack of available energy
        conversion factors.
        <br />
        <br />
        Emissions data points marked with an * have been estimated with average
        CPU Utilization because the actual CPU Utilization is not available.

        <br />
        Cloud Provider regions on map are an approximation based on public
        information given by each cloud provider. Regional grid emissions factor
        sources vary based on country.
